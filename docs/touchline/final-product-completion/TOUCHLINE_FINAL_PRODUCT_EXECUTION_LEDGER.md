# TouchLine Final Product Completion — Current State

This is the sole authoritative continuation ledger. It supersedes the former
Full Product Recovery ledger without deleting its historical evidence.

## Resume protocol

At the beginning of every execution:

1. Inspect `git status --short`.
2. Read `git rev-parse HEAD` and the latest commit.
3. Read this ledger and `touchline-final-product-state.json`.
4. Resolve the newest safe checkpoint from the current branch; never use a
   hardcoded historical checkpoint.
5. Continue the first incomplete executable item below.

Safety boundaries remain unchanged: no Stripe Live, real payments, legal/tax
configuration, destructive production operation, unapproved commercial rule
change, or production promotion.

## Current execution items

| # | Item | Status | Current evidence | Next executable action |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Market Value Engine | EXTERNAL_HARD_GATE | Canonical server-owned import/read architecture, admin workflow, CSV template and safety report exist locally. Football Benchmark is subscriber/download data and FootballTransfers bulk-reuse rights are not confirmed. A Football Benchmark demonstration/quotation is requested as a Football agent / representative for Player Valuation only, to support licensed agents consulting player values through TouchLine. England, Spain, France, Brazil and Germany first divisions were requested; Malta coverage confirmation is pending. | Review Football Benchmark's written proposal for data scope, permitted storage/public display, delivery method and price; retain `Market Value Pending` until reviewed values are imported. |
| 2 | Unified Card Engine | IN_PROGRESS | `77ffadf8`, `67b8c727`, `18134f7f` and `f347f2dc` preserve stored active-contract tier authority through Arena, ClubOwner, exact cards and ClubHub. | Validate the latest Preview with a controlled non-financial ClubOwner persona. |
| 3 | Canonical tiers and borders | COMPLETE | One versioned 0/1/2/4/7/10/15 policy and seven visual tiers; no ranking-derived pricing. | Regression-only. |
| 4 | Active-season stability | COMPLETE | Stored active-contract tier is propagated and browser roster V5 retains its authority marker. | Regression-only. |
| 5 | New-player classification | CODE_COMPLETE | Canonical Card Engine classifies an approved new player without a live gameplay dependency; missing value remains pending. | Validate after an approved import sample exists. |
| 6 | Bench organisation | COMPLETE | Selection follows availability; presentation is GK → DEF → MID → ATA, never value or price. | Regression-only. |
| 7 | Responsive card layout | EXTERNAL_HARD_GATE | Local desktop/mobile evidence exists; controlled authenticated phone/tablet and remote WebKit remain unvalidated. | Run controlled device/browser matrix. |
| 8 | Public provider-brand removal | COMPLETE | Public product wording is TouchLine-branded; provider identities remain internal/Admin metadata. | Regression-only. |
| 9 | Preview validation | IN_PROGRESS | Branch is Git-integrated with Vercel; no production alias change. | Confirm the Preview built from current HEAD and run public smoke tests. |
| 10 | Final Zero-Defect Audit | IN_PROGRESS | Historical completed recovery blocks are preserved; external controlled-persona, historical-data and device gates are separately tracked. | Continue only non-external audit items after current Preview validation. |

## Current external gates

- Controlled non-financial ClubOwner/Admin personas for cross-session and device validation.
- Verified historical player-season coverage before publishing historical totals.
- Approved/licensed market-value source and approved data import before public values can replace pending states.
- Native WebKit/phone accessible validation.
- Deliberate production promotion after all acceptance gates pass.

Latest safe checkpoint at ledger creation: `f347f2dc` on
